# SDA_Megaline

This Project is a project I did at TripleTen. This was one of my earlier ones where the main goal was to be an analyst under the company Megaline, where they had two plans the Surf Plan and the Ultimate Plan. We are going to be  looking at a small number of clients from this company from the year 2018. The goal of this project is based on the behavior of customers in this dataset we are to find out which of the two plans brings in more revenue.

We have 4 dataframes in this datset; calls, internet, messages, and megaline plans. We are going to load those libraries and after that we are going to fix anything in those df such as a wrong dtypes, missing data, duplicated data, etc. After that we'll merge all the datasets. We are going to make a function to define revenue for each user. This way it'll be easier to be able to determine which plan is better. It'll take acount of number of messages sent amount of data used, based off of the parameters of the two plans. We'll do several looks at EDA afterwards, where we compare phone usage of each both plans for each month, comparing the amount of minutes they'll need for each given month, and a box plot displaying the variance of monthly call duration.  We will make graphs comparing the messages, the internet usage , and then comparing the revenue column we created ealier. Last thing after that is creating a hypothesis statement on if were able to determine if the Ultimate Plan brings in more revenue.
